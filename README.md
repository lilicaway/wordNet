# WordNet

This an assignment for the coursera course called [Algorithms part2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) from Princeton University.

[WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) is a semantic lexicon for the English language that computational linguists and cognitive scientists use extensively. For example, WordNet was a key component in IBMâ€™s Jeopardy-playing Watson computer system. WordNet groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets. For example, { AND circuit, AND gate } is a synset that represent a logical gate that fires only when all of its inputs fire. WordNet also describes semantic relationships between synsets. One such relationship is the is-a relationship, which connects a hyponym (more specific synset) to a hypernym (more general synset). For example, the synset { gate, logic gate } is a hypernym of { AND circuit, AND gate } because an AND gate is a kind of logic gate.
